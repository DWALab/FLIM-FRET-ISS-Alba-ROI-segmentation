
1. Organize your data into one folder per well. Each contains subfolders: "Ch1" "Ch2" "Tau" and corresponding Tiff data.
          ie. Main Experiment folder contains subfolders WellA1, WellA2 etc. each contains subfolders Ch1, Ch2, Tau

2. Download ISSWatershedSegmentation_Analysis package and make a copy within your Main Experiment folder. 

3. In ISSWatershedSegmentation_Analysis package > Step1_WatershedSegmentation > open 'LoopThroughMultipleDataFolders.m'  
		Within 'LoopThroughMultipleDataFolders.m' 
			AT THIS LINE
				SHOW_IMAGE_DATA = 0; %change to 1 if you wnat to plot and save ROI data

			change 0 to 1 if you want to plot ROIs.

			AT THIS LINE
			list_of_folders={'',...}
			insert path to each well within ' '.  ie {'C:\Documents\WellA1',...
								  'C:\Documents\WellA1'};
			
			Insert all paths separated by ,... until end '};    
			In the example script delete/add lines as needed.

RUN code

4. OPTIONAL. Change ROI selection parameters for your preference. 

ISSWatershedSegmentation_Analysis package > Step1_WatershedSegmentation > open 'ISSWatershedSegmentation.m'

The following lines can be modified. Next to each line we have commented on what these parameters do.  

	log_size = 50;          % Specifiy size of log filter  TRY 10 for sharper ROIs
	log_sigma = 0.25;        % Specify standard deviation of log filter
	Pixel_threshold = 10;   %  This value defines the foreground pixel threshold for generating binary objects
	separation_between_seeds = 2; % Increase this value, the ROIs will be larger *depending on the scaling_threshold  TRY 4 for larger ROIs.
	scale_threshold = 0.0; % The higher this value then ROIs will be selected in high intesity areas only. TRY 0.4 to start. Set to 0 and Otsu Thresholding is applied instead.  
	Pixel_connectivity = 8; % Specify the connectivity of the pixels can be 4, 8 
	color_map = 'jet';      % Specify the color scheme to be used for ROI image

5. In ISSWatershedSegmentation_Analysis package > Step2_data_binning > open 'LoopThroughDataToBin.m'  			

	in line 
		untransfected_path=
	specify the path to your Untransfected well within, ' '

	in line
		list_of_paths
	copy and paste all other path directories (other than untransfected) from 'LoopThroughMultipleDataFolders.m' script.


TIP * If you have multiple cell lines/drug treatments you must run the script separately and select the appropriate untransfected well for each set of wells.
